Home menu:
The POS system will have two different sets of menus. One menu is for the customers who come to the store to buy products. The other is for the administrator who runs the store. Imagine that the store runs by the administrator who can add new products and is interested to see report at his/her discretion. Therefore, you need to implement the initial menu as follows:

1.Customer
2.Admin

If option 1 is selected, your program will return the previous three menus (Customer menu) as follows:

1.Sale
2.Pay
3.Exit

##Customer Menu:
Option 1 = Sale: Sale mode will enable the following categories(category menu)

1.Bakery
2.Fruits
3.Grocery
4.Vegetables

For each category, the following products will be listed. Thus, if the user selects option 1 from the category menu, all the bread items will be displayed along with their unit price, similar to what you displayed in lab assignment 3.
